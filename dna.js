/* Write a function that takes in a DNA string (for example 'CTAGGGTA') and returns a new string with any non-canonical DNA base values removed. Canonical base values are single characters: 'C', 'T', 'A', and 'G' only. Make the function case sensitive - meaning 'c' (lower case) should be removed from the string, but 'C' (upper case) is a good value and should remain. If the DNA string is empty, just return an empty string. */
